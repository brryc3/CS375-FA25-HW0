What file format is used for this binary? And what architecture is it compiled for?
The file format is ELF64 (see "file format elf64-x86-64").
The architecture is x86-64 (see "architecture: i386:x86-64").

What are some of the names of segment/sections you find?
Some section names are: .interp, .note.gnu.property, .note.gnu.build-id, .note.ABI-tag

What segment/section contains main (the function) and what is the address of main? (It should be the same as what you saw in gdb)
The main function is in the .text section.
The address of main is 0x0000000000001209

Do you see the stack segment anywhere? What about the heap? Explain.
No, The stack is managed by the operating system at runtime, not stored in the binary.
The heap is also not shown as a segment or section in the binary. Heap memory is dynamically allocated at runtime, so it does not appear in the binary's static segments.
